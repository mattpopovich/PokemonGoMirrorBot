# PokemonGoMirrorBot
PokemonGo Bot via screen mirroring

### About
Using [screen mirroring](https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421), click on repeatable locations with random delays and random click accuracy.

### Configuration
Edit the coordinates for your system in [`config.py`](config.py). I'd recommend placing the screen mirroring application in an easily repeatable location (Ex. bottom right of screen).

The coordinates of the current mouse position can be easily obtained via `cmd` + `shift` + `4`.

### Dependencies
